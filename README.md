# hello-world
just for experiment

Hi, I'm zelin.

This project is designed to find the optimal block size based on Circular Block Bootstrap for financial time series. In the ideal situation, the bootstrapped time series should perfectly inherit the characteristics from original time series. Thus, the judgements are set up according to the principle.

Just change for testing the function of feature brach.
